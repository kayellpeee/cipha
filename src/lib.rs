/// One "metric" of an encryption protocol's strength is how little relation
/// there is between the inputs and outputs. AKA there must be either
/// a random difference between input and output, or a consistent output
/// regardless of input
/// i.e. either
///  "a" -> 7, "b" -> 42, "c" -> 0.1451, "de" -> 6623
///  or
///  "a" -> 1.013, "b" -> 1.003, "c" -> 1.201, "de" -> 1.031
/// Both are really hard to draw patterns from & thus reverse engineer the
/// encryption algorithm. To test this we'll find the difference b/w input and
/// output and see if similar inputs map to similar outputs (not random) as long
/// as all inupts don't map to similar outputs (consistent).
